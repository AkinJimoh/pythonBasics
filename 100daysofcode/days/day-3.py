#rite a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.
#
# e.g. 86 is even because 86 รท 2 = 43
#
# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.
#
# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 รท 2 = 29.5

# num = int(input("Please enter a number:\n"))
#
# if num % 2 == 0:
#     print(f"The number {num} is an even number")
# else:
#     print(f"The number {num} is an odd number")


# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.

# w = input("Enter your weight:\n")
# h = input("Enter your height:\n")
# weight = (int(w) / float(h) ** 2)
# bmi = round(weight, 2)
# print(round(bmi, 2))
#
# if bmi <= 18.5:
#     print(f"Your bmi is {bmi} and you are underweight")
# elif bmi <= 25:
#     print(f"Your bmi is {bmi} have a normal weight")
# elif bmi <= 30:
#     print(f"Your bmi is {bmi} are slightly overweight")
# elif bmi <=35:
#     print(f"Your bmi is {bmi} and are obese")
# else:

#Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.
