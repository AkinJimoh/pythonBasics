#You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
#e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]
#The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

#180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
#There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
#1146 รท 7 = 163.71428571428572
#Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
#Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer.
# Try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights:\n").split()
# for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):

# for i in student_heights:
#     new += i
# print(new)
#
# new1 = 0
# for i in student_heights:
#     new1 += 1
# print(new1)

# avg = (new / new1)

#The output words must match the example. i.e
#The highest score in the class is: x

#You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100.
#Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

# cc = 0
# for i in range(2, 101, 2):
#     cc += i
# print(cc)

#or
# cc = 0
# for i in range(1, 101):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         cc += i
# print(cc)

#You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
#Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
#When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
#When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".
# And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`

# for i in range(1, 101):
#     if i % 15 == 0:
